## What is a Keyframe?

A Keyframe is an idea taken from other programs that also have timelines. While keyframes also have a formal definition in animation, for the purpose of this plugin, a Keyframe is simply a saved frame that you'd like to access quickly. That way, instead of trying to remember which frames you deem important or special, you can save them with plugin, then use the `Go To Previous Keyframe` or `Go To Next Keyframe` to jump between them.

Keyframes are stored on a special layer created for you when you add your first keyframe. It is titled "KEYFRAMES". The script will lock this layer so that you don't accidentally draw on it. As you can see in the image below, a Keyframe is a frame on the KEYFRAMES layer that has the cel filled. A normal frame is one with an empty cel. This is your visual indicator of where a keyframe has been placed.
